## A simple command-line OCR tool

This tool conducts optical character recognition (OCR) on documents (pdf) and images (jpeg, png). To use it, download the required libraries listed on requirements.txt, and run the following command:

`python ocr_test.py --input_name ./samples/[filename] --output_name ./outputs/[filename]`

"samples" and "outputs" folders contain a sample image and an output txt file.
