## my portfolio
This repository contains the following:
* `Coursera_assignments` contains the notebooks that I needed to complete to get the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.
* `OCR` contains the code and data for a simple command-line OCR (optical character recognition) tool.
* `Reddit_scraping` contains notebooks for a personal project to get myself familiar with web scraping, topic modeling, and various predictive machine learning models.
