## my portfolio
Each folder in this repository contains the following:
* `Coursera_assignments`: Notebooks of the assignments that I needed to complete in order to get the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera ([link](https://www.credly.com/badges/03150900-c80c-4546-aba0-056d928368ca?source=linked_in_profile) to credential).
* `OCR`: Code and sample data for a simple command-line OCR (optical character recognition) tool.
* `Reddit_scraping`: Notebooks for a personal project to get myself familiar with web scraping, topic modeling, and various predictive machine learning models. 
* `STT_with_GUI`: Code for a simple speech-to-text tool with GUI (build with Kivy).
