I even added extra dark chocolate chips and didn\\'t measure the pb! It was probably pretty high cal but it was also decently healthy and I didn\\'t regret it when I went to sleep.

I always worried I’d start abusing them if I did but I was so constipated that I finally caved and what the fuck?? I wake up at 6am feeling like I’m dying from cramps and run to the toilet. I was so dizzy and I don’t know if it was the lax or the fact that I’ve been restricting or what but I could barely hold myself upright. I ended up having violent diarrhea then promptly passing out on the floor???? Before I’d even wiped??? I feel disgusting. I woke up because my cat had stuck his hand under the door and started smacking my head like oh my god. I for real only took the recommend dose of those like chocolate ex lax like is this normal?
